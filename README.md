# Mapping-and-spatial-code
This repository contains codes used to analyse the data, and to produce the maps and figures included in "Geographic and temporal distributions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus", Robinson, H.A; A thesis submitted to The University of Manchester Faculty of Life Sciences, 2015.

GLM codes should not be run in R version 3.0.2 due to the omission of Poisson regression functions. Version 3.0.1 is therefore recommended for the running of the data analysis codes. If using a later version, please check the documentation regarding how Poisson terms are treated.

The majority of codes omit loops to ensure transparency of code functions and to simplify their future modification to other applications

There are no licenses associated with the content and its reuse and further modification in other projects is therefore encouraged.

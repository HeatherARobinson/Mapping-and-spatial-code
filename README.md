# Mapping-and-spatial-code
This repository contains codes used to analyse data and produce maps included in "Geographic and temporal distributions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus", Robinson, H.A, based on integration of publicly available climate data with user specified coordinates to enable modelling with climate data. Further codes have also been added for the integration of elevation and coastline data.
